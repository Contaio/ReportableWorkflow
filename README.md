# Reportable Workflow

The reportable workflow is a FirstSpirit Module that provides 
different Executables for Release and/or Delete-Workflows.
Additionally, it provides a report to execute a dry-run of the workflow.

The Module is usable in both clients.


# Installation

The module needs to be installed on the FirstSpirit Server.
For each Project, the module needs to be installed as a ProjectApp.

The Report Functionality can be enabled/disabled ProjectApp-wise.

To use it in the Web-Client (ContentCreator), the module needs to be installed as a WebApp.
